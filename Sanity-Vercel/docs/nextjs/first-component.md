### Create a default page using a layout component with columns and a header component

* In the `src`folder, create a new folder called `components`
* Remove the content of the default page we got from vercel
* Update the layout of the file
  * Add the following components
    * Add a header-component
    * Add a column-component
  * Add some dummy content that is displayed in the different components
  * Use [tailwind](tailwind.md) and typescript 

The page should look something like this:

Use regular React components for this, we don't use the app/ directory yet in prod

[Deploy the app to vercel!](deploy.md)
