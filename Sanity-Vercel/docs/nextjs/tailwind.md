### Tailwind
Tailwind CSS, as per their own website is a "utility-first CSS framework" which provides several of these opinionated, single-purpose utility classes that you can use directly inside your markup to design an element.

Some of the utility classes that I frequently use these days are:

    flex: Used to apply Flexbox to a <div>
    items-center: to apply the CSS property align-items: center; to a <div>
    rounded-full: to make an image circular, and so on

Tailwind should already be installed, see the documenation/guide for how yo use it:
