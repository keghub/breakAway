## We are connecting our vercel app to our sanity database

### Part 1:

**Preparation**
* Install the [sanity client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sanity/client) by running `npm install @sanity/client` in the vercel/nextjs app.
* We can now read data from sanity, see the client documentation for a basic sample.
* To be able to access your sanity database, you will need to find the project id, which can be found in the Sanity Studio management ui.
* We also need the name of the dataset, which also can be found in the management ui (if you've followed the previous steps, the name of the dataset will be `production`)

**Excercise**
* The goal is to display the names for the list of sites in sanity in one of the `Column` components.
* Note that to use an async call to load data in react, you can use the `useEffect` hook. See: https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect
  * Read up about the hook, and make sure you understand how it works
* [Deploy the app to vercel!](deploy.md)

_Hint:_ If you get a CORS error, you might need to add the url to your nextjs app in the list of allowed CORS-origins in the Sanity Studio management ui (found under the API-section)

### Part 2:

We want to avoid having secret information hardcoded in the files, and instead move it to the environment variables.

You can read more about using environment variables in nextjs here: https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables

* In the top level folder of your nextjs application, add a file called `.env.local`
* Add the project id, dataset and api version to the file. Note that the names needs to be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to assure that we can access them client side (see: [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables#exposing-environment-variables-to-the-browser))
* Update the code for your sanity client to use the new environment variables instead
* Assure it's still working
* [Deploy the app to vercel!](deploy.md)
  * Note that we need to add the environment variables in vercel as well to be able to deploy our app now
